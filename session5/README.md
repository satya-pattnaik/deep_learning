The contents of the Session were as follows:
- Introduction to PyTorch
- PyTorch vs TensorFlow
- Tensors
- AutoGrad
- Tensors and Numpy
- Sharing Memory for Performance
- Tensor Indexing
- Squeezing and Unsqueezing and Other Operations
- Writing a NN from scratch in Pytorch:
- Working with dataset
- Building a network
- Accessing the weights
- Forward Function
- Training
- Loss
- Gradients
- Weight Updates
- Batch Training
- Epochs


## Code Structure
The code is divided into the following strcture
- **model.py**
- **utils.py**
- **S5.ipynb**

### model.py
This file contains the code **block 7**.
It has the definition of the model or the Neural Net.

### utils.py
